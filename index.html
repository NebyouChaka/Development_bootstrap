                    <span>There</span> is a famous quote from Picasso: <em>“Good artists copy, great artists steal.” Many famous artists are deeply influenced by work done before their time. If not by direct exposure, the ideas artists are exposed to through other people and media inevitably influence them</em>.
                    
                    Van Gogh admired and studied the works of many artists including Rembrandt and Doré. He allegedly copied 21 paintings of Jean Francois Millet and here you can see that Van Gogh’s Rest from Work was clearly inspired by Millet’s Noonday Rest.
                    
                    Andy Warhol’s The Last Supper was clearly inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper. He created more than 100 paintings and works on paper based on Da Vinci’s masterpiece.
                    
                    Developers are inspired through work done by others, as well. We Google search to see if a problem we’re trying solve has been solved before and reuse it, often saving days or weeks of work. Most developers fork projects on GitHub to alter or improve an existing piece of work. We use and contribute to open source projects. We get ideas from fellow developers on Twitter. We learn from other companies who have gone through scalability challenges and published their designs. This is common practice in the software development community.
                    
                    In the zone
                    There’s a reason you’ll see developers wearing headphones. Coding often requires deep concentration and getting into the “zone.” It’s often when they are at their most productive. Time passes in the blink of an eye, brilliant solutions appear, complex code with numerous pieces that interact can be created — and it all just flows out automatically. Artists are also known for getting in the zone, often spending hours or even days working continuously on a project.

                    <p id="gallery-paragraph-2" style="font-family: Calibri"><span>Great</span> pieces of work often take weeks or months, whether it’s creating a painting or coding a software system.
                    
                        Code is clay.Creating great works of art take time and perseverance. Some artists are lucky and create that great piece of work quickly, but for most others it takes perseverance and a long time. It supposedly took Leonardo da Vinci 14 years to create the Mona Lisa. Jay DeFeo’s The Rose took almost eight years to create, weighed over 2,300 pounds and had to be forklifted out of her house.
                    
                    Creating a great piece of software can often take months or even years until you get to the final product. Like an artist you often get stuck and feel like giving up, until you have a breakthrough. However, unlike a piece of art that is unveiled in the gallery, software is best when “released over time” — first launched as an MVP and then followed up with many subsequent releases. It can still take years to get to the final product you initially dreamed of.
                    
                    Art (and software) decay over time
                    Pieces of art decay over time. That’s why we have art restorers. Software is known to rot and decay over time, first incurring technical debt and sometimes eventually turning into legacy code. Code that is not maintained, pruned or updated degrades over time and become impossible to work with and difficult to comprehend. This is why developers refactor code, to keep it up to date and remove technical debt. Refactoring is the fine art restoration of the digital world.
                    
                    Many developers are artists
                    Many developers actually are artists, literally. Just take a look around at some of the people in this field.
                    
                    Leonardo da Vinci was a painter and sculptor. He was also an engineer, architect, mathematician, and inventor.</p>
